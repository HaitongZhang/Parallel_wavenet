# Parallel_wavenet
This is to present some sample voices from Wavenet model. 

The models are trained using Biaobei Data (about 12hour of Mandarin speech). 

The teacher model is trained by 900k-step, while the student model is trained only by 500k-step now (need to be trained by around 800k-step).
